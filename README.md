# Python_SageMaker_ACME-Device-Failure-Detection
## Background
ACME has provided you with a daily set of parameters for their devices. There is also a column, "failure", that indicates whether or not the device has failed. The goal is to use the data to develop a model to predict failure of the devices that minimizes both false positives and false negatives.
